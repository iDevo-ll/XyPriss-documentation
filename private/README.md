## Overview

XyPriss is a **Hybrid Enterprise-Grade Web Framework** that bridges the power of **Rust** with the flexibility of **TypeScript**.

### Cross-Platform Foundation

At its core, XyPriss is engineered for universal high-performance. We provide native Rust binaries (XFPM & XHSC) for:

| OS          | Architecture            | Status           |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Linux**   | x86_64 (AMD64)          | ✅ Supported     |
| **Linux**   | aarch64 (ARM64)         | ✅ Supported     |
| **Windows** | x86_64 (AMD64)          | ✅ Supported     |
| **Windows** | aarch64 (ARM64)         | ✅ Supported     |
| **macOS**   | x86_64 (Intel)          | 🛠️ Source-only\* |
| **macOS**   | aarch64 (Apple Silicon) | 🛠️ Source-only\* |


_We are committed to future-proofing our engine for emerging architectures like RISC-V._

At its heart lies **XHSC (XyPriss Hybrid Server Core)**, a high-performance Rust engine that handles low-level networking, advanced routing, and system telemetry. This unique hybrid architecture allows developers to build secure, scalable applications using TypeScript while benefiting from Rust's raw performance and multi-core efficiency.

### Architecture & Tools

XyPriss operates on a unified strategy:

1.  **XHSC (Rust Engine):** Manages the HTTP/S stack, ultra-fast radix routing, and real-time hardware monitoring. It acts as the high-speed gateway for all incoming traffic.
2.  **Node.js Runtime:** Provides the enterprise-ready application layer where developers manage business logic, security middlewares, and data processing using TypeScript.
3.  **XFPM (XyPriss Fast Package Manager):** Our ultra-fast, Rust-powered developer tool. **We highly recommend using `xfpm` for all operations.** It provides optimized resolution, ultra-fast extraction, and caching tailored for the XyPriss ecosystem. [Learn more about XFPM](./docs/xfpm.md).

### Core Features

- **High Performance XHSC Engine** - Independent Rust server core implementation with multi-core clustering support and high-precision system telemetry.
- **Security-First Architecture** - 12+ built-in security middleware modules including CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and intelligent rate limiting.
- **Advanced Radix Routing** - Ultra-fast routing system powered by Rust, capable of handling complex path matching with microsecond latency.
- **File Upload Management** - Production-ready multipart/form-data handling with automatic validation and error handling.
- **Extensible Plugin System** - Permission-based plugin architecture with lifecycle hooks and security controls.
- **Native Production Integration** - Built for automated deployments and SSL management via [XyNginC](https://github.com/Nehonix-Team/xynginc).
- **Multi-Server Support** - Run multiple server instances with isolated configurations and security policies.

---

We strongly recommend using the **XyPriss CLI (`xyp`)** for the fastest and most reliable developer experience.

```bash
# Install the CLI (Recommended)
npm install --global xypriss-cli

# Install XyPriss in your project
xyp install xypriss # or xfpm i xypriss
```

Alternatively, using standard package managers:

```bash
xfpm i xypriss
# or
yarn add xypriss
```

For additional security features:

```bash
xfpm install xypriss-security
```

---

## Quick Start

### Using CLI

```bash
xfpm init
cd my-app
xyp dev
```

### Manual Setup

```typescript
import { createServer } from "xypriss";

const app = createServer({
    server: { port: 3000 },
    security: { enabled: true },
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Hello from XyPriss" });
});

app.start();
```

# XFPM: XyPriss Fast Package Manager 🕶️

XFPM is the high-performance package manager and CLI tool for the XyPriss ecosystem, written in Rust. It serves as the official successor to the previous Go-based CLI, offering ultra-fast dependency resolution, a unique "Matrix-style" terminal interface, and deep integration with XyPriss projects.

## Key Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Engineered in Rust for maximum performance.
- **Matrix-Style UI**: Technical, professional, and consistent terminal feedback with hexadecimal pulses and zero emojis.
- **Strict Isolation**: Implementation of a virtual store for dependency isolation (similar to pnpm).
- **Neural Graph Resolution**: Advanced dependency resolution engine that maps your project's neural graph.
- **Global & Local Support**: Manage packages globally or locally with ease.
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Full support for existing npm/package.json ecosystems.

## OS & Architecture Support

XFPM is designed for universal high-performance execution.

## Installation

XFPM is now distributed via the official unified installer. For complete platform-specific instructions, please refer to the [**Installation Guide**](./INSTALLATION.md).

### Quick Install (Unix/macOS)

```bash
curl -sL https://xypriss.nehonix.com/install.js | node
```

### Uninstallation

To remove the engine:

```bash
curl -sL https://xypriss.nehonix.com/install.js | node - uninstall
```

_Note: The installer automatically handles architecture detection and system PATH configuration._

## Basic Usage

### Initialize a project

```bash
xfpm init
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
xfpm install                      # or xfpm i (install all from package.json)
xfpm add <pkg>                    # or xfpm i <pkg>
xfpm i <pkg> -D                   # Save to devDependencies
xfpm i <pkg> -E                   # Save exact version (no ^)
xfpm i <pkg> -O                   # Save to optionalDependencies
xfpm i <pkg> -P                   # Save to peerDependencies
```

### Run & Execute

```bash
xfpm dev                          # Alias for 'xfpm start'
xfpm run test.ts                  # Execute a script using bun/node
xfpm index.ts                     # Shorthand for 'xfpm run index.ts'
xfpm -- prisma generate           # Execute from node_modules/.bin (npx-like)
```

### Global installations

```bash
xfpm i -g pkg-name                # Install a package globally
```
